This model is copyright Arlo Belshee and Anders Ivarsson. We fully intend to release it under a license that allows commercial use. Therefore we need to keep the copyright clean.

If you want to fix typos, go ahead. If you want to do anything more substantive, please contact us first. We'll ask you to explicitly assign copyright over your changes so that we can later publish the model. We'd hate to make a legal mistake that prevents us from publishing our work for everyone to use freely.
